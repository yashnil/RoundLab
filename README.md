# RoundLab

**AI flow coach for novice and JV Public Forum debaters.**

RoundLab helps debaters practice and improve through AI-powered coaching. Record a speech, get judge-style feedback, and complete personalized drills that target your specific weaknesses.

---

## What RoundLab Does

1. **Record or Upload** — Capture a 45-90 second PF speech (constructive, rebuttal, summary, final focus, crossfire)
2. **Transcribe** — Automatic speech-to-text via OpenAI Whisper
3. **Extract Flow** — AI identifies every claim, warrant, evidence, and impact in your speech
4. **Generate Coaching Report** — Judge-style feedback with scores, priorities, strengths, weaknesses, and actionable recommendations
5. **Create Drills** — Three personalized practice exercises targeting your skill gaps (warranting, weighing, drops, clash, judge adaptation)
6. **Track Progress** — Dashboard with XP, levels, badges, skill averages, and drill completion
7. **Team Mode** — Coaches can create teams, invite students, and monitor practice progress

## Features

### Core Workflow
- ✅ Audio recording (browser MediaRecorder) or file upload (MP3, WAV, M4A, WebM, OGG, MP4)
- ✅ Whisper transcription with word count validation
- ✅ Structured argument extraction (claim → warrant → evidence → impact)
- ✅ Judge-style feedback with 5-dimension scoring (clash, weighing, extensions, drops, judge adaptation)
- ✅ Personalized drill generation (3 drills per speech, skill-targeted)
- ✅ Drill attempts with re-recording and progress tracking

### Gamification (Practice-Focused)
- ✅ **Drill-First XP System**: Rewards practice and completion, not just recording
  - +5 XP per flow generated
  - +10 XP per feedback report
  - +15 XP per drill assigned
  - +10 XP per feedback rating
  - +50 XP per first drill attempt (biggest reward!)
  - +20 XP per repeat drill attempt
  - +25 XP bonus for completing full practice loop (feedback + drills + attempts)
  - **No XP for speech upload/transcription** — level up by completing drills and practice attempts
- ✅ Level progression (Level 1: 0-99 XP, Level 2: 100-249, Level 3: 250-499, Level 4: 500-899, Level 5: 900-1399, Level 6+: 1400+ [+300 per level])
- ✅ **Practice-Focused Badges**: First Feedback, First Drill Attempt, Practice Habit (3 attempts), Full Practice Loop, Feedback Analyst (3 reports), Team Player
- ✅ Skill averages dashboard (clash, weighing, extensions, drops, judge adaptation)

### PF Rubric Calibration (Speech-Type-Specific Scoring)
- ✅ **Expert-Grounded Rubrics**: Different scoring dimensions for each PF speech type
  - **Constructive**: Case Structure (20) · Warranting (25) · Evidence Use (20) · Impact Development (20) · Clarity (15)
  - **Rebuttal**: Clash/Refutation (30) · Coverage (20) · Response Quality (20) · Evidence Comparison (15) · Strategic Framing (15)
  - **Summary**: Extension Quality (25) · Collapse Strategy (20) · Frontlining (20) · Weighing (25) · Judge Clarity (10)
  - **Final Focus**: Ballot Story/Voters (30) · Comparative Weighing (25) · Crystallization (20) · Consistency (15) · Judge Adaptation (10)
- ✅ **Speech-Type Awareness**: Constructive speeches are not penalized for missing clash or extensions; Rebuttal emphasizes direct refutation; Summary focuses on extensions and weighing; Final Focus prioritizes voters and crystallization
- ✅ **Calibrated Scoring**: 90-100 = Tournament-Ready · 80-89 = Strong · 70-79 = Solid · 60-69 = Developing · 50-59 = Flawed but Complete · 40-49 = Major Issues · 30-39 = Severely Underdeveloped · <30 = Incomplete
- ✅ **Novice/JV Calibration**: Complete constructives with evidence and clear advocacy score 50-60 even with weak warrants (not 30); 30-39 reserved for severely underdeveloped or incoherent speeches
- ✅ **Topic-Aware Examples**: Coach Diagnosis uses the student's actual speech topic and claims in before/after improvement examples (e.g., Section 230 examples for tech policy speeches)

### Authentication
- ✅ Supabase Auth with PKCE OAuth flow
- ✅ Google sign-in
- ✅ Session persistence and automatic token refresh

### Team Features
- ✅ **Multi-Team Hub**: Users can join multiple teams (student or coach role)
- ✅ Create team (auto-generates 6-character invite code)
- ✅ Join team (enter invite code from coach)
- ✅ **Coach Dashboard**: View all students' progress in one place
  - Speech count, drills assigned, drill attempts
  - Last practice date for each student
  - Aggregate team stats (total members, speeches, drills, attempts)
- ✅ **Invite Workflow**: Copy invite code or full invite message to share with students
- ✅ **Privacy**: Coaches see progress metadata, not audio recordings or full transcripts

### UI/UX
- ✅ **Theme System**: Full dark/light mode with CSS custom properties (oklch color space)
  - Dark mode: `--color-canvas: oklch(0.065 0.002 264)`, `--color-ink: oklch(0.975 0.001 264)`
  - Light mode: `--color-canvas: oklch(0.985 0.001 264)`, `--color-ink: oklch(0.095 0.002 264)`
  - Toggle persists via localStorage, transforms entire app
- ✅ **Personalized Homepage**: Adapts based on login state (shows name, level, quick actions)
- ✅ **Team Hub**: Multi-team management, coach dashboard, student progress tracking
- ✅ **Smart Speech Workspace**: Reorders sections when session is complete (Coaching Report → Drills → Flow → Transcript)
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile-first, tested on phone/tablet/desktop)
- ✅ Motion animations (stagger, fade-up, card hover, AnimatePresence transitions)
- ✅ **Coaching Report Format**: Summary hero card, "Fix These First" priority cards, judge ballot, coach diagnosis with before/after examples, action checklist
- ✅ Flow visualization with color-coded argument cards (offense, defense, weighing, response, unclear)
- ✅ Coach diagnosis cards with targeted examples, disclaimers, and expandable before/after comparisons
- ✅ Accessible buttons (size-sm: h-8, size-default: h-9, size-lg: h-10)

supabase/migrations/20260604000000_add_xp_ledger.sql       # XP + scoring version
supabase/migrations/20260606000000_add_drill_time_limit.sql # Drill time_limit_seconds
```

**Storage bucket:** Create a bucket named `audio` with public read access for audio files.

**New columns added in Pass 4/5 (already in migrations):**
| Table | Column | Type | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| `speeches` | `duration_seconds` | `integer` | Set from recording timer or HTMLAudioElement |
| `drills` | `time_limit_seconds` | `integer CHECK(30–300)` | LLM-generated, NULL for older drills |
| `argument_maps` | `arguments.id` | (JSONB field) | e.g. `"arg_1"`, assigned in app layer |
| `feedback_reports` | `raw_feedback.structured_issues` | (JSONB field) | Present in v2+ reports only |

## Deployment Safety

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Backend tests pass (`pytest`)
- [ ] Frontend builds without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Environment variables configured in production
- [ ] Supabase migrations applied
- [ ] Audio storage bucket configured (`audio` bucket with public read)
- [ ] CORS origins updated for production domain

### Known Deployment Considerations
- **Audio uploads**: Ensure Supabase storage `audio` bucket has public read access for playback
- **OpenAI API**: Monitor usage and set billing alerts (Whisper + GPT-4o calls)
- **Session persistence**: Supabase Auth tokens persist via localStorage and cookies
- **Theme toggle**: Persists in localStorage, safe for SSR (checked on mount)

---

## Limitations & Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Audio formats**: Limited to MP3, WAV, M4A, WebM, OGG, MP4 (max 50MB)
- **Speech length**: Optimized for 45-90 second speeches (PF format)
- **AI accuracy**: Flow extraction and feedback quality depend on audio clarity and speech structure
- **Team management**: No leave team or remove member functionality yet (coaches must manually manage)
- **Drill attempts**: Currently manual status tracking (no automated verification)
- **Mobile recording**: Browser MediaRecorder support varies (upload recommended for iOS Safari)

### Roadmap Considerations
- Real-time collaboration (live team practice sessions)
- Case library and opponent research tracking
- Tournament prep mode (bracket simulation, judge adaptation profiles)
- Advanced analytics (trend analysis, peer comparison)
- Integration with Tabroom.com for tournament results
- Drill verification (AI checks if drill attempt matches prompt)
- Video upload support (for crossfire and body language feedback)

## Product Philosophy

**Make the app feel like coaching, not cheating.**

RoundLab is built for **practice**, not case generation. The core loop is:
1. Record a speech you're already prepared to give
2. Get judge-style feedback on delivery and argumentation
3. Complete targeted drills to fix specific weaknesses
4. Re-record to track improvement

This is **not** an AI case writer. It's a **practice partner** that gives you feedback and drills, just like a coach would.
